# Personal Website

Hi, I made this personal website from a Bootstrap template a while back. I actually think it looks pretty nice, so I decided to keep it.

Currently it only has some general information about me, as well as some insights I gained from some of the courses I took. I intend to add some of my programming projects on there as well.

Here's the [link to the website itself](https://sinancang.github.io/). As well as the [link to the template I used](https://bootstrapmade.com/free-html-bootstrap-template-my-resume/).
